Installation GuidePrerequisitesEnsure that you have the following software installed before proceeding with the setup:* Python (>= 3.8)* Git* Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)* GPU Support (if available, CUDA/cuDNN for TensorFlow/PyTorch)Clone the RepositoryTo get started, clone this repository using Git:git clone https://github.com/shakibarajabi/GDEL-Task-Offloading/cd GDEL-Task-OffloadingCreate and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended)It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Run the following commands:On Windows (PowerShell):python -m venv venvvenv\Scripts\activateOn macOS/Linux:python3 -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activateInstall DependenciesUse the provided requirements.txt file to install all necessary dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txtIf you need GPU acceleration, ensure you have the correct versions of CUDA and cuDNN installed. Check the official documentation of TensorFlow or PyTorch for compatibility.Verify InstallationTo verify that everything is installed correctly, run:python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__)"This should output the installed versions of TensorFlow and PyTorch.Dataset and Pretrained Model SetupSome scripts require datasets or pretrained models. Follow these steps:1. Download Dataset:o Place datasets inside the data/ folder.o Ensure the correct format as required by the scripts.2. Pretrained Models (if applicable):o Download and place them in the models/ directory.Running the ProjectAfter installation, you can run the main scripts as follows:Training the Modelpython train.pyRunning Performance Analysisjupyter notebook performance_analysis.ipynbRunning Simulationspython environment.pyTroubleshooting* If you encounter dependency errors, try updating: * pip install --upgrade pip* pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt* For TensorFlow/PyTorch GPU issues, ensure that CUDA/cuDNN is correctly installed.* If Jupyter Notebook doesn’t start, install it manually: * pip install notebook* jupyter notebookAdditional Resources* TensorFlow Installation Guide* PyTorch Installation Guide* Git Documentation

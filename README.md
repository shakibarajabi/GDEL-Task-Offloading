GDEL: GEO-DISTRIBUTED EDGE LAYERING FOR TASK OFFLOADING

A Mobility-Aware MEC Simulation with DDQN-Based Task Offloading

This repository contains the GDEL (Geo-Distributed Edge Layering) framework, a reinforcement learning-driven task offloading model designed for Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) environments. The system optimizes task offloading, resource allocation, and network efficiency while considering user mobility, interference, and network conditions.

üìå FEATURES
‚Ä¢	Task Offloading Model: Uses MDP and DDQN for intelligent decision-making
Geo-Distributed Edge Layering (GDEL): GAONs (Geo-Aware Offloading Nodes) and ROHs (Regional Offloading Hubs) dynamically allocate computing resources

‚Ä¢	Network-Aware Optimization: Factors in bandwidth, interference, latency, and power constraints

‚Ä¢	Mobility Prediction: Uses nonlinear motion models for user position tracking
Resource Allocation: Dynamically distributes computational load based on network congestion

‚Ä¢	Performance Evaluation: Includes real-world metrics like task completion time, offloading latency, and energy consumption
